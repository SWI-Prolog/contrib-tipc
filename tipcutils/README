Incredibly, tipc-config is not distributed with the Linux kernel.

CAUTION:

Use this version of tipc-config at you own risk. Using a version
of the tool that is not contemporaneous with the loadable module
may crash the module. You are strongly encouraged to go and find
a version that is compatible with your system.

This version was used on Fedora 8, (kernel 2.6.26) without any
difficulty.
